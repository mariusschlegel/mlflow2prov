MLflow2PROV is a Python library and command line tool for extracting provenance graphs from ML experiment projects that use Git repositories and MLflow tracking. The underlying data model is compliant with the [W3C PROV](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/) specification.

For a discussion of the ideas, please see the following paper:

* Marius Schlegel and Kai-Uwe Sattler: [*MLflow2PROV: Extracting Provenance from Machine Learning Experiments*](https://doi.org/10.1145/3595360.3595859). 7th Workshop on Data Management for End-to-End Machine Learning (DEEM@SIGMOD '23), June 18, 2023, Seattle, WA, USA.

If you publish work that uses MLflow2PROV, please cite MLflow2PROV and use the [corresponding BibTeX entry](#citing) below.

## Installation

MLflow2PROV can currently be installed via [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) (soon also available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org)). For instructions on installing Poetry, please see [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). MLflow2PROV currently requires either Python 3.10 or 3.11. Thus, you may be required to install Python (using [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)) and tell Poetry to use this version (in the following, exemplarily for Python 3.10):

```bash
sudo dnf install -y openssl-devel libffi-devel bzip2-devel readline-devel sqlite-devel xz-devel tk-devel  # exemplary installation of Python dependencies in Fedora 38
pyenv install 3.10.11
poetry env use 3.10.11
```

MLflow2PROV uses Graphviz for exporting provenance graphs in the `dot` format. Since Graphviz is not available as a Python package, the installation with the distribution's package manager may be required as follows:

```bash
sudo dnf install graphviz  # exemplary installation in Fedora 38
```

Then, install MLflow2PROV and its dependencies with Poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

To currently use all features of MLflow2PROV, the application of two minor patches to the MLflow installation is required. You can apply the patches locally as follows:

```bash
patch .venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/mlflow/utils/search_utils.py < patches/mlflow-2.4.1-search_utils.patch
patch .venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/mlflow/store/model_registry/sqlalchemy_store.py < patches/mlflow-2.4.1-sqlalchemy_store.patch
```

Specifically, these patches adjust the `FileStore` and `SQLAlchemyStore` Model Registry backend implementations to also enable reading deleted `ModelVersion` objects. This is especially required to create instances of the `RegisteredModelVersionDeletion` provenance model. The issue has been already reported to the MLflow project (see <https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/8225>).

The dependencies for development can be installed via Poetry's `--with` option:

```bash
poetry install --with dev
```

## Getting Started

The repository [`mlflow2prov-quickstart-example`](https://github.com/mariusschlegel/mlflow2prov-quickstart-example) provides a ready-to-run ML project including a prepared MLflow instance that can be used to try out MLflow2PROV. Please read [`mlflow2prov-quickstart-example/README.md`](https://github.com/mariusschlegel/mlflow2prov-quickstart-example/blob/main/README.md) for detailed instructions.

## Usage

MLflow2PROV can be currently run from within the virtual environment created by Poetry inside the project's root directory via

```bash
poetry run mlflow2prov [OPTIONS] COMMAND1 [ARGS]... [COMMAND2 [ARGS]...]...
```

or

```bash
poetry shell
mflow2prov [OPTIONS] COMMAND1 [ARGS]... [COMMAND2 [ARGS]...]...
```

If the project's MLflow Tracking Server uses HTTP authentication, then it is possible to set the credentials via environment variables as follows:

```bash
poetry shell
export MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME="myusername"
export MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD="mypassword"
mflow2prov [OPTIONS] COMMAND1 [ARGS]... [COMMAND2 [ARGS]...]...
```

Alternatively, `poetry run` can be used together with a shell script containing the commands listed above.

Further MLflow environment variables can be set analogously (see [documentation](<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#logging-to-a-tracking-server>)).

The command line interface of MLflow2PROV can be used either used with a chain of commands and options or, alternatively, by providing a configuration file in `.yaml` format.

### Command Line Usage

The command line interface provides commands that can be chained together like a Unix pipeline.

```
Usage: mlflow2prov [OPTIONS] COMMAND1 [ARGS]... [COMMAND2 [ARGS]...]...

  Extract provenance information from ML experiment projects that use Git
  repositories and MLflow tracking.

Options:
  --version        Show the version and exit.
  --verbose        Enable logging to stdout.
  --config FILE    Read configuration from file.
  --validate FILE  Validate configuration file and exit.
  --help           Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  extract     Extract a provenance document from an ML experiment project...
  load        Load provenance documents from one or more file(s).
  merge       Merge one or more given provenance documents into a single...
  save        Save one or more provenance documents to file(s).
  statistics  Print statistics for one or more provenance documents.
  transform   Apply a set of transformations to one or more given...
```

MLflow2PROV can be invoked as follows:

```bash
mlflow2prov extract --repository_path "/home/user/dev/mlproject-foo" --mlflow_url "http://localhost-foo:5000" \
            extract --repository_path "/home/user/dev/mlproject-bar" --mlflow_url "http://localhost-bar:5000" \
            load --input example.rdf                                                                          \
            transform --use_pseudonyms --eliminate_duplicates                                                 \
            merge                                                                                             \
            save --output result --format json --format rdf --format xml --format provn --format dot          \
            statistics --resolution fine --format table
```

### Configuration File Usage

MLflow2PROV supports configuration files in `.yaml` format that are functionally equivalent to command line invocations. To read configuration details from a file instead of specifying on the command line, use the `--config` option:

```bash
mlflow2prov --config examples/config/example.yaml
```

You can validate your configuration file (e.g. to check for syntactical errors) before as follows:

```bash
mlflow2prov --validate examples/config/example.yaml
```

A configuration file functionally equivalent to the [above command line invocation example](#command-line-usage) is specified as follows (see also `examples/config/example.yaml`):

```yaml
- extract:
        repository_path: "/home/user/dev/mlproject-foo"
        mlflow_url: "http://localhost-foo:5000"
- extract:
        repository_path: "/home/user/dev/mlproject-bar"
        mlflow_url: "http://localhost-bar:5000"
- load:
        input: [example.rdf]
- transform:
        use_pseudonyms: true
        eliminate_duplicates: true
- merge:
- save:
        output: result
        format: [json, rdf, xml, provn, dot]
- statistics:
        fine: true
        format: table
```

### Provenance Output Formats

MLflow2PROV supports multiple output formats provided by the [`prov`](https://github.com/trungdong/prov) library:

* [PROV-N](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-n/)
* [PROV-O](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) (RDF)
* [PROV-XML](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-xml/)
* [PROV-JSON](http://www.w3.org/Submission/prov-json/)
* [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org) (DOT)

### Integrations

For further processing and usage of the output files, some exemplary helpers are provided in the directory `examples/integrations/`, which demonstrate and simplify the integration of MLflow2PROV with other systems:

* the graph DBMS [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com) supporting Cypher queries,
* the NoSQL DBMS [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) supporting MQL queries,
* the RDF triple store [Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/index.html) supporting SPARQL queries, and
* the visualization software [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org) for DOT file processing.
